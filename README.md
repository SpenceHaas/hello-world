# hello-world

Hello World,
I have a goal to become a Master Coder in San Diego.
To do this I need to learn and master several different programs like;

GitBash/GitHub - This is first on the list. All coders are expected to know this.

CMD Prompt - I have avoided this for too long.

Sublime Text

Chrome Developer Tools

HTML/CSS - the fundamentals of coding

JavaScript

I will learn and Master all of these programs this year and become a highly sought after software engineer this year
